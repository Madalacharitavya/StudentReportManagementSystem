This is a C++ program that manages student records using file handling. Let's go through the explanation of the program step by step:

1. The program starts by including the necessary header files: `iostream`, `fstream`, and `iomanip`. These headers provide input/output stream operations, file stream operations, and input/output manipulation respectively.
2. A class named `student` is defined, which represents a student record. It has private data members for roll number (`rollno`), name (`name`), marks in different subjects (`e_marks`, `ec_marks`, `m_marks`, `d_marks`, `c_marks`), percentage (`per`), and grade (`grade`). The class also has member functions to calculate the grade (`calculate()`), get student data from the user (`getdata()`), display student data on the screen (`showdata()`), display student data in a tabular format (`show_tabular()`), and retrieve the roll number (`retrollno()`).
3. After the `student` class definition, there are several function declarations for various operations like writing a student record to a binary file, displaying all records, displaying a specific record, modifying a record, deleting a record, displaying the overall class result, displaying individual student results, and displaying an introductory screen.
4. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu-driven interface that allows the user to select different options. The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
5. The `write_student()` function prompts the user to enter student details, creates a `student` object, and writes the object's data to a binary file named "student.dat". The file is opened in binary append mode to add records without overwriting existing data.
6. The `display_all()` function reads all records from the "student.dat" file and displays them on the screen by calling the `showdata()` function for each student object.
7. The `display_sp(int n)` function accepts a roll number as input, reads records from the "student.dat" file, and displays the record of the student with the matching roll number.
8. The `modify_student(int n)` function searches for a student record with the given roll number in the "student.dat" file. If found, it displays the existing data, prompts the user to enter new details, updates the record, and writes it back to the file.
9. The `delete_student(int n)` function deletes a student record with the given roll number from the "student.dat" file. It creates a temporary file, copies all records except the one to be deleted to the temporary file, and then replaces the original file with the temporary file.
10. The `class_result()` function reads all student records from the "student.dat" file and displays them in tabular format by calling the `show_tabular()` function for each student object.
11. The `result()` function presents a sub-menu for result-related options. It allows the user to choose between displaying the overall class result, displaying an individual student's report card, or going back to the main menu.
12. The `intro()` function displays a simple introductory screen.
13. The `entry_menu()` function presents a sub-menu for entry/edit operations. It allows the user to choose between creating a student record, displaying all records, searching for a specific record, modifying a record, deleting a record, or going back to the main menu.
That's the overview of the program. It provides basic functionality to manage student records using file handling in C++.
